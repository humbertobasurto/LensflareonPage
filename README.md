This is a website I plan to move on from the development stage and into development as my
main art website. The look and feel of it is meant to be simplistic and to the point, with the focal point being the images
(provided by pexels for now) and the art I have worked on or will in the future. The colors of the main page are a little retro 
and are supposed to be a play on the name "Lens(FLARE)on". The prints section will be replaced by "Shop" in the future for all kinds 
of art but right. It is designed in a very simple looking card view (the kind of interface you would expect from the local library 
website) that has information on the artwork, price and a description. You can click on prints and they will be added to a cart which
has limited funcitonality at the moment. The contact page on this website is a bit lackluster as I plan on developing artwork and
getting some fun pictures to personalize it to my liking for future deployment.
